# We use classes to define NEW TYPES. These types can have methods that we define in the body of the class and they also
# have attributes that we can set anywhere in our programs

# Basic types examples in Python:Numbers, Strings and Booleans
# Complex types examples in Python: Lists, Dictionaries
